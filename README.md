<h1 align="center"> Logo Detection from bills(pdf) using YoloV4 and DarkNet </h1>

![uni](img/canadian-logo.jpeg)

Abstract : <p > This project aims to develop a logo detection system that can accurately detect and localize logos from bills of telecommunication companies using the Darknet framework and YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The system will leverage state-of-the-art object detection techniques to automate the process of logo detection from telecommunication bills, making it faster and more efficient.

Key Features:

- Data Collection and Preparation: A dataset of telecommunication bills with annotated logo regions will be collected or created. The dataset will be carefully curated and annotated to provide accurate training data for the logo detection model.

- Darknet Framework: The Darknet framework, a popular open-source deep learning framework, will be utilized as the foundation for implementing the logo detection system. Darknet provides a flexible and efficient platform for training and deploying deep neural networks.

- YOLOv4 Model: YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, will be employed to detect and localize logos within the telecommunication bills. YOLOv4 offers superior accuracy and speed compared to other object detection algorithms.

- Model Training: The YOLOv4 model will be trained on the annotated dataset to learn the visual features and patterns associated with telecommunication company logos. The training process will involve optimizing the network's parameters to achieve high accuracy in logo detection.

- Logo Recognition: Once the logos are detected and localized, the system will include an additional component for logo recognition. This step may involve employing a separate classifier or implementing a recognition algorithm to identify and associate each logo with the corresponding telecommunication company.

- Evaluation and Fine-tuning: The trained logo detection model will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance. Fine-tuning techniques may be employed to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the system.</p>

**üéá You are Ready to Go!**

## ‚ùó Installation of Important Libraries

Before running the .ipynb file we need to import some of the libraries using terminal 

In the Anaconda Terminal, you can run:

```Bash
pip install opencv-python
```

For installing TKinter (If it shows the error that Tkinter is not installed)

```Bash
pip install python-tk
```

## Installation of labelImg

- LabelImg - LabelImg is a free, open source tool for graphically labeling images. It‚Äôs written in Python and uses QT for its graphical interface. It‚Äôs an easy, free way to label a few hundred images 

- Open Anaconda Terminal and write run command

```Bash
sudo pip3 install labelimg
```


## Use of labelImg in the project 

- Step1 - Write the command labelImg in the Anaconda Terminal which will open a window as shown below.

```Bash
labelimg
```

![labelimg](img/labelimg.png)

- Step2

- Load all the images from the directory and mark all the images by their respective classes

![labelimg_scotia](img/labelimg_scotia.jpeg)

- You will get a classes.txt file after labeling all the images of dataset

##  Important topics used in the Project

Darknet

- Darknet is an open-source neural network framework known for implementing the YOLO algorithm. It enables efficient training and deployment of deep neural networks for object detection tasks, such as logo detection. Darknet's flexibility allows customization of network architectures and training configurations. It supports real-time processing and offers tools for data augmentation. By using Darknet with YOLOv4, the logo detection system achieves accurate and efficient detection and localization of telecommunication company logos from bills.

YoloV4

- YOLOv4 pretrained weights are pre-learned parameters of a YOLOv4 model. They capture the knowledge gained from training on a large dataset, including logo detection. These weights serve as a starting point for fine-tuning or transfer learning. By utilizing pretrained weights, developers can accelerate the training process and benefit from the model's ability to detect logos and other objects. Fine-tuning on specific data further refines the model's performance for logo detection on telecommunication bills.
